# Minimalist Content-to-Consultation Sales Funnel

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the minimalist, content-driven sales funnel for Theoforge, leveraging automation to efficiently guide prospects from initial content consumption to a booked consultation. It integrates with the overall [Brand Strategy](../docs/theoforge_integrated_brand_strategy.md) and [Content Strategy Loop](../docs/content-strategy-loop.md).

## Core Philosophy: Do Less, Better

This system operates on three key principles:

1. **Ruthless Simplicity**: Eliminate everything that doesn't directly contribute to converting content readers into consultation clients
2. **Closed-Loop Attribution**: Maintain clear visibility of which content drives valuable consultations 
3. **Sustainable Automation**: Automate only what delivers meaningful ROI on your time investment

## The 3-Step Funnel

```
Content Publication → Lead Capture → Consultation Booking
```

### Step 1: Streamlined Content Publication

**Goal**: Publish high-quality content consistently with minimal friction

**Process**:
1. Create content in Google Docs using consistent templates
2. When ready, add to GitHub `src/content/blog` folder
3. Deploy automatically through existing site integration

**Essential Tools**:
- Google Docs for content creation
- GitHub for content storage and versioning
- Discord for team communication
- Zapier for basic automation

**Key Automation (Zapier)**:
```
Name: Content Publication Alert
Trigger: New file added to GitHub src/content/blog
Action 1: Extract metadata (title, description, tags)
Action 2: Post announcement in Discord #content-alerts channel
Action 3: Schedule LinkedIn post with article link and description
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create content templates in Google Docs with consistent frontmatter structure
2. Set up Discord #content-alerts channel for publication notifications
3. Configure GitHub webhook to trigger Zapier workflow
4. Create LinkedIn post templates for different content types
5. Test end-to-end publication workflow

### Step 2: Frictionless Lead Capture

**Goal**: Convert content readers into identifiable leads with minimal friction

**Process**:
1. Reader consumes valuable content on your site
2. Newsletter signup form or content upgrade captures email
3. Lead is tagged with content source and enters nurture sequence

**Essential Tools**:
- Simple newsletter form on blog posts
- Content-specific lead magnets for high-value topics
- Email marketing platform (ConvertKit/Mailchimp)
- Google Analytics for basic tracking

**Key Automation (Zapier)**:
```
Name: Lead Capture Processing
Trigger: New newsletter signup or lead magnet download
Action 1: Add subscriber to email platform with source tags (including content pillar)
Action 2: Send welcome email with value-add and consultation CTA
Action 3: Update lead source tracking in Google Sheet (including pillar)
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Add consistent newsletter signup component to blog post template
2. Create 2-3 high-value lead magnets for key topics
3. Set up UTM parameters for content source tracking
4. Implement email welcome sequence with consultation call-to-action
5. Configure Google Analytics goals for signup conversion tracking

### Step 3: Consultation Booking

**Goal**: Convert qualified leads into booked consultations with clear attribution

**Process**:
1. Lead receives emails with consultation CTAs
2. Prospect books time through Calendly with qualification questions
3. Team receives notification with lead source information
4. Pre-consultation materials sent based on content interests

**Essential Tools**:
- Calendly for appointment scheduling
- Discord for consultation alerts
- Email templates for pre/post consultation communication

**Key Automation (Zapier)**:
```
Name: Consultation Booking Handler
Trigger: New consultation booked through Calendly
Action 1: Post alert in Discord #consultations channel with lead source
Action 2: Create Google Calendar event with preparation time blocks
Action 3: Send client preparation email with custom content based on source
Action 4: Update consultation tracking spreadsheet with source data
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Configure Calendly with qualification questions and limited availability
2. Set up Discord #consultations channel for booking alerts
3. Create consultation preparation email templates
4. Design consultation tracking spreadsheet with source attribution
5. Test end-to-end booking workflow

## Minimal Viable Measurement System

**Goal**: Measure only what matters for improving consultation bookings

**Core Metrics**:
1. **Content Performance**: Views, Time on Page, Social Shares (by Pillar)
2. **Lead Conversion**: Email Signups per Post/Pillar, Signup Rate % (by Pillar)
3. **Consultation Rate**: Consultations per Content Source/Pillar
4. **Business Impact**: Client Conversions by Original Content Source/Pillar

**Simple Monthly Review Process**:
1. Pull basic metrics into single dashboard view
2. Identify top-performing content for promotion and repurposing
3. Spot underperforming content for improvement or retirement
4. Adjust content calendar based on what drives consultations

**Key Automation (Zapier)**:
```
Name: Monthly Performance Summary
Trigger: Schedule (1st day of month)
Action 1: Pull metrics from Google Analytics, Email Platform, Calendly (aggregated by pillar where possible)
Action 2: Update Google Sheet dashboard with monthly figures (including pillar breakdowns)
Action 3: Generate performance summary (highlighting pillar performance)
Action 4: Post monthly review in Discord #analytics channel
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create simple Google Sheet dashboard with key metrics
2. Configure API connections to data sources
3. Set up scheduled monthly report automation
4. Establish 30-minute monthly review meeting

## GA4 Analytics Implementation Plan

### GA4 Fundamentals for Content-to-Consultation Tracking

**Objective**: Create a streamlined analytics implementation that tracks the entire user journey from content consumption to consultation booking.

#### 1. GA4 Property Setup & Configuration

**Basic Configuration**:
- Create dedicated GA4 property for the consulting website
- Configure data retention for maximum period (14 months)
- Set up cross-domain tracking if using separate booking domain
- Enable enhanced measurement for file downloads, outbound clicks

**User Properties Configuration**:
- `user_source`: Original traffic source (e.g., linkedin, organic, newsletter)
- `user_content_affinity`: Primary content topics engaged with
- `user_pillar_affinity`: Primary strategic content pillar engaged with
- `lead_status`: Visitor, lead, or consultation_booked

**Content Groups Configuration**:
- Configure content groups by topic (AI, Strategy, Implementation)
- Configure content groups by format (Article, Podcast, Case Study)

#### 2. Event Tracking Implementation

**Core Event Taxonomy**:

| Event Name | Description | Parameters |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| `view_content` | Views content piece | `content_id`, `content_type`, `content_topic`, `content_pillar` |
| `content_milestone` | Reaches key milestone | `milestone_type`, `content_pillar` |
| `lead_capture` | Signs up or downloads | `capture_method`, `content_source`, `lead_magnet`, `content_pillar` |
| `consultation_view` | Views booking page | `source`, `content_id`, `content_pillar` |
| `consultation_start` | Begins booking process | `source`, `content_pillar` |
| `consultation_complete` | Completes booking | `source`, `consultation_type`, `originating_pillar` |

**Next.js Implementation**:

```typescript
// src/lib/analytics.ts
export const trackEvent = (eventName: string, parameters: Record<string, any>) => {
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.gtag) {
    window.gtag('event', eventName, parameters);
  }
};

// Usage examples
export const trackContentView = (contentId: string, contentType: string, contentTopic: string, contentPillar: string) => {
  trackEvent('view_content', {
    content_id: contentId,
    content_type: contentType,
    content_topic: contentTopic,

    milestone_type: milestoneType,
    content_pillar: contentPillar
  });
};

export const trackLeadCapture = (captureMethod: string, contentSource: string, leadMagnet: string, contentPillar: string) => {
  trackEvent('lead_capture', {
    capture_method: captureMethod,
    content_source: contentSource,
    lead_magnet: leadMagnet,
