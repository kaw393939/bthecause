# Theoforge - Spacing Guide (v1.0)\n\n## 1. Spacing Philosophy & Strategy\n\nConsistent and intentional spacing is crucial for establishing visual hierarchy, rhythm, clarity, and a sense of professional order throughout the Theoforge digital presence. It reduces cognitive load for users and reinforces the brand's core attributes of structure, precision, and trustworthiness, essential for engaging a C-suite audience.\n\nOur strategy is based on the **8-Point Grid System**, a widely adopted standard in modern UI design.\n\n## 2. The 8-Point Grid System\n\n*   **Base Unit:** The fundamental unit for all spacing is **8 pixels**. In Material UI, this corresponds to `theme.spacing(1)`.\n*   **Consistency:** ALL spatial values (margins, padding, gaps) MUST be multiples of this 8px base unit.\n*   **Implementation:** Leverage Material UI's `theme.spacing()` utility EXCLUSIVELY for defining spacing. Avoid hardcoded pixel values (e.g., `12px`, `20px`).\n    *   `theme.spacing(1)` = 8px\n    *   `theme.spacing(2)` = 16px\n    *   `theme.spacing(3)` = 24px\n    *   `theme.spacing(4)` = 32px\n    *   And so on...\n*   **Fractional Units:** For finer control where necessary (e.g., between an icon and tightly associated text), use half-unit steps: `theme.spacing(0.5)` = 4px.\n\n## 3. Standard Spacing Scale & Usage\n\nWhile context matters, these standard multiples provide a baseline for common use cases:\n\n*   **Tight Spacing (`theme.spacing(0.5)` - `theme.spacing(1)`: 4px - 8px)**\n    *   Use cases: Internal padding within very small elements (small chips, badges), gap between an icon and its immediate label.\n*   **Standard Spacing (`theme.spacing(2)` - `theme.spacing(3)`: 16px - 24px)**\n    *   Use cases: Default internal padding for components like Cards, Buttons (vertical/horizontal may differ slightly but use the scale), spacing between related items in a list or group (e.g., form fields, blog meta items), gap between heading and subsequent content.\n*   **Medium Spacing (`theme.spacing(4)` - `theme.spacing(6)`: 32px - 48px)**\n    *   Use cases: Separating distinct components within a section (e.g., between text block and image), vertical spacing between list items or cards in a grid/stack where more breathing room is desired.\n*   **Wide Spacing (`theme.spacing(8)` - `theme.spacing(12)+`: 64px - 96px+)**\n    *   Use cases: Vertical separation between major page sections, defining overall page/container padding (especially horizontal padding on larger screens).\n\n## 4. Implementation Guidelines\n\n*   **Use Theme:** Always use `theme.spacing()` via the `sx` prop or `styled()` components.\n    *   Example: `sx={{ padding: theme.spacing(3) }}` or `sx={{ marginTop: 4 }}` (MUI automatically multiplies integers by `theme.spacing()`).\n*   **MUI Components:** Leverage MUI layout components like `<Stack spacing={2}>` or `<Grid container spacing={3}>` which inherently use the theme spacing.\n*   **Consistency Over Literal Ratios:** Prioritize the consistency of the 8pt system over attempting to force exact irrational ratios like Phi. The system itself creates harmony.\n*   **Review & Refine:** Regularly review component spacing during development and visual QA to ensure consistency and effectiveness.\n\n## 5. Relation to Typography\n\nLine height should generally be managed via the typography scale definitions in `theme.ts` (`lineHeight` property). While based on relative units (`em` or unitless), the resulting pixel values should feel harmonious with the 8pt grid. Spacing *between* text elements (e.g., margin below a paragraph) follows the 8pt grid rules.\n\n---\n*Version 1.0 - Based on 8-point grid best practices.*\n
