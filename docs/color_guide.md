# Theoforge - Color Guide (v1.3 - Tailwind CSS, Design Psychology & Contextual Application)

## 1. Color Philosophy & Psychological Strategy (Reinforced)

Color is a primary subconscious communicator of **Theoforge's identity as The Sage**: the discerning, expert guide bringing **structured clarity** to technological complexity. Our color strategy is precisely engineered to evoke **trust, intellectual rigor, calm competence, and objective authority** in senior enterprise leaders (CEO/CIO/CTO). It aims to reduce cognitive load, facilitate effortless comprehension, signal premium wisdom, and provide focused guidance, all while demonstrating meticulous professionalism through universal accessibility.

**Core Psychological Objectives (Reiterated):**

*   **Establish Foundational Trust & Calm Confidence:** Primary Teal signals stability, reliability, and measured intellectual depth.
*   **Optimize Cognitive Processing & Clarity:** Structured Neutrals minimize visual noise, maximize readability, and underscore objectivity.
*   **Signal Premium Expertise & Enduring Value:** Secondary Gold accents subtly convey achieved wisdom and the high value of strategic insight.
*   **Direct Attention with Purposeful Precision:** Accent Orange highlights critical information or guides decisive action, mirroring the Sage's focused guidance.
*   **Embody Professionalism & Accessible Knowledge:** Rigorous adherence to WCAG AA+ contrast standards is fundamental.

## 2. Core Palette: Psychological Intent & Configuration (Refined)

This palette **must be configured** in `tailwind.config.js` under `theme.extend.colors`. Rationale is critical for consistent application.

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        // Primary: Deep Teal - Calm competence, intellectual depth, stability, trust. Authoritative but not overly dominant.
        primary: {
          DEFAULT: '#00695C', // Teal 700 (Main - Balanced authority)
          light: '#26A69A',   // Teal 500 (Hover/Focus states - Approachable interaction cue)
          dark: '#004D40',   // Teal 900 (Strong grounding, deep expertise signal)
          lightest: '#E0F2F1', // Teal 50 (Subtle backgrounds, highlighting containers)
        },
        // Secondary: Muted Gold - Achieved wisdom, premium value, insight highlight. Use with extreme reserve.
        secondary: {
          DEFAULT: '#B8860B', // DarkGoldenrod (Main - Signals high value/key insight)
          // Variants rarely needed; maintain singularity for impact. Consider a slightly desaturated version for subtle print accents if required.
        },
        // Accent: Focused Orange - Precise attention direction for critical actions/data. Signals decisiveness.
        accent: {
          DEFAULT: '#F57C00', // Orange 700 (Main - Primary CTA, critical alerts)
          // Variants rarely needed; maintain singularity for impact.
        },
        // Neutrals: Gray Scale - Structure, clarity, objectivity, minimal cognitive load. Foundation of the UI.
        neutral: {
          // Renaming suggestion for semantic clarity: e.g., neutral-text-primary, neutral-border-subtle
          900: '#111827', // Gray 900 (Strongest text/structural contrast) - Adjusted for deeper black
          800: '#374151', // Gray 700 (Primary body text - Optimal readability) - Adjusted for slightly softer primary text
          700: '#6B7280', // Gray 500 (Secondary text/metadata - Clear hierarchy) - Adjusted for standard secondary
          500: '#9CA3AF', // Gray 400 (Disabled states/placeholders)
          300: '#D1D5DB', // Gray 300 (Subtle borders/dividers)
          200: '#E5E7EB', // Gray 200 (Slight background variation/Card backgrounds)
          100: '#F3F4F6', // Gray 100 (Hover states on neutrals, off-white backgrounds)
           50: '#F9FAFB', // Gray 50 (Lightest background/paper feel)
        },
        // Backgrounds: Primarily light Neutrals for clarity and focus in light mode.
        background: {
          DEFAULT: '#FFFFFF', // Primary page background (Maximum Clarity)
          paper: 'var(--color-neutral-50)', // Card/module background
          // Consider using primary-lightest for specific highlighted sections if needed.
        },
        // System Feedback: Clear semantic indicators, ensuring accessibility.
        feedback: {
          error:   '#DC2626', // Red 600 (Slightly brighter for visibility)
          info:    '#2563EB', // Blue 600 (Clear informational cue)
          success: '#16A34A', // Green 600 (Clear positive confirmation)
          warning: '#F59E0B', // Amber 500 (Requires dark text - Use neutral-900)
        }
      },
      // Add subtle focus ring styles aligned with Sage (e.g., thin, primary or neutral)
      ringColor: theme => ({
        ...theme('colors'),
        'primary-focus': theme('colors.primary.light'), // Example
      }),
      ringWidth: { // Example
        'focus': '2px',
      },
      ringOffsetWidth: { // Example
        'focus': '2px',
      }
    },
  },
  plugins: [
    // Consider adding headless UI or Radix plugin for enhanced accessibility primitives if using
  ],
};
```

*   **Rationale Enhanced:** More specific psychological descriptions for each color family.
*   **Neutral Palette Adjusted:** Slightly shifted standard Tailwind gray names to specific hex codes for fine-tuning contrast and feel, potentially using slightly cooler grays to enhance the Teal's intellectual feel. Added comments for potential semantic renaming in code (`neutral-text-primary`, etc.) for better developer experience.
*   **Feedback Colors Refined:** Adjusted some feedback colors for potentially better standard contrast/visibility while retaining semantic meaning. Explicitly noted dark text requirement for warning.
*   **Focus States Added:** Included example configuration for focus rings, essential for accessibility and conveying deliberate interaction, a Sage trait.

## 3. Color Usage Guidelines & Psychological Application (Expanded)

*   **Foundation (Trust & Clarity):** Reinforce: Use `bg-white` or `bg-neutral-50` for primary backgrounds. `text-neutral-800` for body ensures comfort during prolonged reading (essential for absorbing wisdom). `text-neutral-900` for headings establishes clear authority. Use `border-primary` or subtle `bg-primary-lightest` to delineate key structural areas or guidance sections.
*   **Hierarchy & Structure:** Emphasize systematic use. `border-neutral-300` defines boundaries clearly but unobtrusively. Use `bg-neutral-100` or `bg-neutral-200` for nested elements (like sidebars, code blocks, or blockquotes) to create depth and structure without color noise.
*   **Highlighting Wisdom (Secondary Gold):** Reiterate extreme sparsity. *Specific Use Cases:* Key performance indicators (KPIs) in dashboards, pull quotes of critical insights, author names on thought leadership pieces, perhaps subtle decorative elements in highest-level reports. **Never** interactive. Its purpose is to signal *achieved* value.
*   **Directing Focus (Accent Orange):** Reiterate single primary CTA per view. *Specific Use Cases:* "Book Consultation," "Download Strategic Framework," "Finalize Assessment." Also applicable for critical error states or urgent system messages within `Alert` components. Secondary CTAs: `bg-primary` for important actions, `outline` or `ghost` variants with `text-primary` or `text-neutral-800` for less critical actions.
*   **Interactive States:**
    *   **Hover/Focus:** Interactive elements (`Button`, `Link`, navigation items) using `bg-primary` should transition to `bg-primary-light` (or `dark` depending on base) for clear but calm feedback. Neutral interactive elements hover to `bg-neutral-100`.
    *   **Focus Rings:** Use thin (`ring-focus`), offset (`ring-offset-focus`) rings in `ring-primary-focus` for keyboard navigation â€“ signals precision and accessibility.
*   **Data Visualization:** Use the Neutral scale for base chart elements. Employ Primary Teal for primary data series. Use Accent Orange *or* Secondary Gold (choose one consistently for charts) *only* to highlight the single most critical data point or series requiring attention. Prioritize clarity over decoration.

## 4. Accessibility & Contrast (Reinforced & Expanded)

*   **Minimum:** WCAG 2.1 AA remains mandatory.
*   **Enhanced Target:** **AAA** for all body text (`text-neutral-800` on `bg-white`/`bg-neutral-50`) and primary UI text is strongly recommended for demonstrating meticulous care and ensuring readability for all users.
*   **Verification:** Mandatory, automated checks in CI/CD pipelines if possible, plus manual checks during design reviews.
*   **Specific Checks:** Reiterate need for dark text on Gold/Orange/Warning backgrounds. Text on `bg-primary` must be light (e.g., `text-white` or `text-neutral-50`). Text on `bg-primary-dark` must be light.

## 5. Dark Mode Considerations (New Section)

*   **Philosophy:** Maintain the core Sage principles of clarity, structure, and calm authority while reducing eye strain in low-light environments. Hierarchy and focus must be preserved. Avoid pure black backgrounds; opt for dark Neutrals.
*   **Palette Mapping (Example):**
    *   `background.DEFAULT`: `neutral-900`
    *   `background.paper`: `neutral-800` (or a custom very dark gray)
    *   `text.primary` (body): `neutral-100` or `neutral-200`
    *   `text.secondary`: `neutral-300` or `neutral-400`
    *   `primary.DEFAULT` (accents): `primary.light` (Teal 500 might offer better visibility)
    *   `secondary.DEFAULT`: `secondary.DEFAULT` (Gold may need slight brightness increase for visibility on dark bg)
    *   `accent.DEFAULT`: `accent.light` (Orange may need adjustment for accessible contrast)
    *   Borders: Lighter Neutrals (`neutral-700` or `600`).
*   **Implementation:** Utilize Tailwind's `dark:` variant (`dark:bg-neutral-900`, `dark:text-neutral-100`). Requires careful configuration and testing.

## 6. Implementation Notes (Refined)

*   **Source of Truth:** `tailwind.config.js`. Centralize all color definitions.
*   **Utility-First:** Enforce utility class usage. Discourage arbitrary color values.
*   **Component Abstraction:** **Crucial.** Build themed Shadcn components (or wrappers) that handle light/dark mode switching, interactive states, and correct text/background pairings internally. This ensures consistency and psychological intent implementation across the application with minimal developer overhead. E.g., `<ThemedButton variant="primary">` applies all correct classes for default, hover, focus, dark mode.
*   **Cross-Media Consistency:** Ensure palette translations for print and presentation materials maintain the same psychological hierarchy and feel.
