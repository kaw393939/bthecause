Each icon should be distinct but clearly part of a unified set with consistent line weight, corner treatment, and stylistic approach. For Personalized Learning, incorporate elements suggesting individualized pathways or custom experiences. For Collaborative Intelligence, show connected elements or partnership symbols. For Evidence-Based Innovation, include data or research visualization elements. For Educational Research, incorporate academic or discovery motifs. For Learning Technology, blend educational and technological elements. The icons should be simple enough to work at small sizes while maintaining enough detail to be meaningful. The style should be professional, clean and modern, suitable for a forward-thinking educational technology organization.
