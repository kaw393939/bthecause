# Theoforge Website Image Generation Prompts (v1.0)

## Prompt 1: Hero Image / General Brand Essence

**Objective:** Generate a sophisticated, clean, and insightful image for a website hero section or general branding, representing Theoforge's mission (AI transformation guidance) and Sage archetype (wisdom, clarity, expertise).

**Detailed Prompt:**

"Create a high-resolution, wide-aspect ratio (16:9) image embodying clarity, structured knowledge, and guided AI transformation. The style should be modern, professional, and subtly abstract digital art, avoiding clichés.

Visualize a central motif suggesting interconnected knowledge or structured data pathways – perhaps inspired by clean, luminous network graphs, subtly evolving geometric patterns, or stylized, interconnected nodes like a simplified knowledge graph. This motif should feel ordered and understandable, not chaotic.

The background should be clean and uncluttered, possibly a soft gradient using Light Gray (`#F0F0F0`) transitioning to White (`#FFFFFF`), or a very subtle texture suggesting digital space.

Incorporate the Theoforge color palette:
*   **Dominant:** Use Deep Teal (`#008080`) for the primary elements of the central motif (lines, nodes, illuminated pathways) and potentially Dark Gray (`#333333`) for supporting structures or subtle text elements if applicable.
*   **Accents:** Use Muted Gold (`#B8860B`) sparingly for highlighting key connections or points of insight within the motif, adding a touch of value and wisdom.
*   **Focal Point (Optional):** If a call-to-action element were conceptually present, Bright Orange (`#FFA500`) could be used for a single, small, focused point of light or energy, but avoid making it dominant in a general brand image.
*   **Neutrals:** Use Light Gray (`#F0F0F0`) and White (`#FFFFFF`) extensively for background and negative space.

The overall mood should be calm, intelligent, insightful, and forward-looking. Lighting should be soft and diffused, creating a sense of clarity and focus without harsh shadows.

**Avoid:** Overt depictions of robots, brains, binary code streams, generic business people, overly futuristic or sci-fi elements, cluttered compositions, overly bright or garish colors. The feeling should be sophisticated guidance, not flashy technology."

**Notes for Use:**

*   Adjust the aspect ratio (`16:9`) as needed for different placements (e.g., square for blog post thumbnails).
*   For specific section backgrounds (e.g., Services), you might simplify the central motif or focus on a specific color (like Teal or Gold accents on a neutral background).
*   Experiment with variations: "subtle human element collaborating with abstract data visualization", "stylized gear motif echoing the logo integrated subtly", "pathway leading towards an illuminated goal".
