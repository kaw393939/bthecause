### 4.5. Imagery Style

*   **Goal:** Visually reinforce the Sage archetype: clarity, structure, insight, and guided transformation.
*   **Motifs:**
    *   **Structured Knowledge:** Clean network graphs, orderly geometric patterns, simplified knowledge graphs, clear data visualizations (abstracted, not literal charts unless essential).
    *   **Guided Pathways:** Luminous lines or pathways suggesting a clear route through complexity, potentially leading towards a point of insight (subtle gold accent).
    *   **Transformation/Integration:** Abstract visuals suggesting the merging of data/technology with business processes in an orderly way (e.g., stylized gears integrating smoothly, abstract patterns evolving).
*   **Style:** Modern, professional, clean digital art. Focus on ample white space and structured composition. Use the brand palette strategically (Teal dominant, Gold for insight, Orange for focus points if needed).
*   **Avoid:** Clichés (robots, brains, circuits), generic stock photos, overly complex or chaotic visuals, dark/dystopian themes.
*   **Source:** Aim for custom generation or carefully curated abstract graphics.
*   *See specific generation guidance in [Prompts](./prompts.md).*
