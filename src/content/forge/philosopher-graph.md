An interactive visualization platform that maps the complex relationships between philosophers, their ideas, and influences across the history of thought. This project leverages Neo4j graph database technology to represent philosophical connections that traditional hierarchical systems cannot easily capture.

Key features include:
- Interactive network visualization allowing intuitive exploration of philosophical movements
- Timeline-based filtering to discover how ideas evolved across different eras
- Detailed philosopher profiles with biographical information and key contributions
- Relationship mapping showing teacher-student connections and intellectual influences
- Search functionality to quickly find specific philosophers or concepts
