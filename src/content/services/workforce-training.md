*   **Technical Debt Reduction Techniques:** Training engineering teams to identify opportunities for AI-assisted refactoring and modernization.

We offer customized workshops, online modules, and train-the-trainer programs to ensure your team is confident and competent in utilizing AI as a force multiplier rather than viewing it as a replacement threat.
