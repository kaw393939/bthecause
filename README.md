- **The Sage**: Wisdom, Understanding, Truth, Inquiry, Clarity
- **The Creator**: Innovation, Creation, Building, Future-Forward

Our color palette reflects these archetypes with rich purple (transformation), vibrant turquoise (innovation), and warm amber (human connection) to create a distinct and purposeful visual identity.
